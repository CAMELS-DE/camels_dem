          Geometry file containing station locations for which to extract topographic attributes.
          Must contain the ID property with the name specified in the `id_field_name` parameter, the property 
          `gauge_elevation` with the elevation of the station in meters (from gauge metadata), and the 
          geometry with the location of the station.
